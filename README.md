## XYZReader

XYZReader is a short story reading app that was redesigned by me as part of the Udacity Android Developer course following Google's Material Design guidlines. This includes consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion and surfaces.

To get the app running just clone the repository and get the code into Android Studio.
